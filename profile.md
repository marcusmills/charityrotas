The Charity Rotas Project
===
Background
---
My partner Melissa is a Night Support Worker for a very well known charity providing housing and care to the mentally handicapped community. 

Her manager created all the rotas for the staff using basic tools like Excel and Word.  There a a number of disadvantages and I thought there has to be a better way.  There is, but it isn't cheap.  So I thought, it shouldn't be hard for charities to do this and what if I could give them a free tool to make their lives easier, so they could spend more time caring and less time in admin. 

The purpose of this project is to create an app which does the following:

Make managing shifts easy and enjoyable for managers
Empower shift workers
Save charities money
